 Random Quote Generator
    HTML Structure: The page has a section to display a random quote and a "Refresh" button.

    PHP Script: The generate_quote.php file contains an array of quotes. When the page loads, the PHP script randomly selects one quote from the array and displays it within the designated section.

    Refresh Button: When you click the "Refresh" button, the page reloads, and the PHP script runs again, selecting and displaying a new random quote.
